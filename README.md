    The fastest way to develop rtos app with python3
</p>

### Why is Twin awesome
- ðŸš€ **Quick start**: Due to its expressiveness, you can create and deploy a production-ready web app from scratch with very few lines of concise, consistent, declarative code.
- ðŸ˜Œ **No boilerplate**: By abstracting away complex full-stack features, there is less boilerplate code. That means less code to maintain and understand! It also means easier upgrades.
- ðŸ”“ **No lock-in**: You can deploy the Wasp app anywhere you like. There is no lock-in into specific providers; you have full control over the code (and can actually check it out in .wasp/ dir if you are interested ).
